The Tale of Bikesharing in the United States
========================================================

In this project we look at bikeshare data from bikeshare companies in Boston (Hubway) and New York City (Citi Bikes). As bikesharing services begin to roll out in many US cities, bike sharing is becoming a more sustainable option for commuters. Or is it??
With the rise of bikesharing services all across the united states, we decided that 2018 was a good time to look at the publicly available bikesharing data. 

In the repository, we (Swopnil and Giang) have taken around 7 million rides from publicly available data and distributed our analysis into many parts. Below is how we have documented the process of our data analysis. This analysis will be divided into five parts. 

* :ref:`Overview of the Data`
* :ref:`Riders' Stories in a Day`
* :ref:`Looking from Above`
* :ref:`From Where to Where`
* :ref:`Conclusion`

This is my attempt to 

Setup Instructions
----------------------
How did we setup the datasets like we did. 
Before we setup the data, firstly let's setup the data like we did. 

Firstly, in a terminal window clone the git repository.
::.. code-block:: console
    $ git clone https://github.com/swopnilnep/DataVisualization
    $ cd /data/bikeshare/

If the directory does not exist, make a directory in the location

::.. code-block:: console
    $ mkdir data`
